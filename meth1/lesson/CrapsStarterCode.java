	The shooter shoots (rolls) the dice.

If he rolls a 2,3, or 12,that’s Craps and he loses.
If he rolls a 7 or 11, that’s a Natural and he wins.
Otherwise:

the value he rolled is now called the Point
the shooter continues to shoot (roll) until he either rolls the Point again at which point he wins or he rolls a 7 at which point he loses.
