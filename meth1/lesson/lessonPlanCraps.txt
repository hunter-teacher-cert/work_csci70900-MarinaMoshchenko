LESSON PLAN - CRAPS GAME, DEVELOPING AN ALGORITHM FOR CODING

/Supporting file are in the folder 
## Lesson objective:
Developing an algorithm for coding in a programming language on the example of Craps game.

### Aim:
To understand the process of developing an algorithm for coding in a programming language

### Warm up
time: 5-7min
Students watch the video about Craps game 
video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvpmD6NXPfw

### Lesson Content
time: 10 min
Students read about the rules for the Craps game:
A round is played as follows:

The shooter shoots (rolls) the dice.

If he rolls a 2,3, or 12,that’s Craps and he loses.
If he rolls a 7 or 11, that’s a Natural and he wins.
Otherwise:

the value he rolled is now called the Point
the shooter continues to shoot (roll) until he either rolls the Point again at which point he wins or he rolls a 7 at which point he loses.
The main program should take a parameter from the command line, play that many rounds and as it plays indicate each time the shooter wins or loses. 
The program should also print out the status of the rounds they occur. 

Students will get 2 dice per pair(or small group) and try to play the game using the rules.

### Lesson Activity
time: 20-25 min for parts 1 and 2. If time permits, start part 3. Part 3 is for the second block of 40 min time.
1. Drawing a flowchart for the Craps game, with indication of decomposition and abstracted subalgorithms . 
Tools to be used: lucidchart.com, MS Office Word or PowerPoint, paper and pencil, etc. 
2. Outline the steps and write a pseudocode, using three methods described in a starter code.
3. Developing the code for Craps game using a starter code (skeleton) with instructions in it.
---

### Closing
time: 5-7 min
Students will post their flowcharts and pseudocode to a shared platform for review and comparisons.

CRAPS STARTER CODE:

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.util.Random;

//TEAM: /YOUR NAMES ARE HERE/

public class Craps{
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		//call your methods here
		}

	//method "roll" should accept an integer parameter and returns a random number between 1 and that number, inclusive
	public static int roll(int dice){
		//your code apperas here
		}
	
	
	
	//method "shoot" should accepts two parameters - a number of dice and the maximum value for those dice and returns the result of rolling those dice
	public static int shoot( int numOfDice, int max){
			//your code appers here
		return result;
	}
		
	//method "round" should accept no parameters and it should return something to indicate if the shooter of the round wins or loses
	public static int round(){
			//your code appears here
	}
		
	
} //End of class
